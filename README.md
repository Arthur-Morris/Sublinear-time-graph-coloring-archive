# Sublinear-time-graph-coloring-archive
i wrote this code in the summer of 2019 for my honours project at carletion university.it is based primarly on the paper "Sublinear Algorithms for (Î”+1) Vertex Coloring" by Sepehr Assadi, Yu Chen, Sanjeev Khanna. avalabe at https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08886, see the file "Arthur Morris Honours Project Final.pdf" for the full write up. 

there are signifagent problems with this code, i am in the prosses of evaluating this code and reimplementing this algorithim in the repo "Sublinear-time-graph-coloring" this repo is an arcive of my honours project, it is not maintained.
